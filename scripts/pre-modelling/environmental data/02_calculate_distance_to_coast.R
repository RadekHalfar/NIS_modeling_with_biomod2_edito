# Calculate Distance to Coast from Bathymetry Layer
################################################################################
# 
# Purpose: Create a distance-to-coast layer to add to environmental stacks
#          For each ocean cell, calculate distance to nearest land/coast
#
# Input:   base.tif - Bathymetry layer from Bio-ORACLE
#          (Ocean cells = data values, Land cells = NA)
#
# Output:  distcoast.tif - Distance to coast in kilometers
#
# Method:  Uses aggregation to speed up distance calculation,
#          then disaggregates back to original resolution

# Run this script from your project root directory, e.g.:
# setwd("/path/to/your/project")
# All outputs will be written relative to that directory.

# Step 1: Create ocean mask
# Ocean cells where bathymetry exists (non-NA) = 1
# Land cells where bathymetry is NA remain NA
ocean_mask <- base
ocean_mask[] <- NA  # Start with all NA
ocean_mask <- mask(ocean_mask, base, updatevalue = 1)  # Set ocean cells to 1

# Check the mask

# Step 2: Aggregate to speed up distance calculation
# Aggregating by factor 4 reduces computation time ~16x
# (4x4 = 16 cells become 1 cell)

# Ensure distance layer only covers ocean cells
